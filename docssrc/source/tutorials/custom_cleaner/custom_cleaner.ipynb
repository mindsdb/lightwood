    "## Using your own pre-processing methods in Lightwood\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Date: 2021.10.07\n",
    "\n",
    "For the notebook below, we'll be exploring how to make **custom pre-processing** methods for our data. Lightwood has standard cleaning protocols to handle a variety of different data types, however, we want users to feel comfortable augmenting and addressing their own changes. To do so, we'll highlight the approach we would take below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/commonlitreadabilityprize/data?select=train.csv). \n",
    "\n",
    "The data has several columns, but ultimately aims to use text to predict a *readability score*. There are also some columns that I do not want to use when making predictions, such as `url_legal`, `license`, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we're going to focus on making changes to 2 columns: \n",
    "(1) **excerpt**, a text column, and ensuring we remove stop words using NLTK. <br>\n",
    "(2) **target**, the goal to predict; we will make this explicitly non-negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, for this ACTUAL challenge, negative and positive are meaningful. We are using this as an example dataset to demonstrate how you can make changes to your underlying dataset and proceed to building powerful predictors.\n",
