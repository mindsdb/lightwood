    "# Tutorial - Implementing a custom analysis block in Lightwood\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might already know, Lightwood is designed to be a flexible machine learning (ML) library that is able to abstract and automate the entire ML pipeline. Crucially, it is also designed to be extended or modified very easily according to your needs, essentially offering the entire spectrum between fully automated AutoML and a lightweight wrapper for customized ML pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we can identify several different customizable \"phases\" in the process. The relevant phase for this tutorial is the \"analysis\" that comes after a predictor has been trained. The goal of this phase is to generate useful insights, like accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, feature importance, etc. These particular examples are all included in the core analysis procedure that Lightwood executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the analysis procedure is structured into a sequential execution of \"analysis blocks\". Each analysis block should generate a well-defined set of insights, as well as handling any actions regarding these at inference time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, one of the core blocks is the Inductive Conformal Prediction (`ICP`) block, which handles the confidence estimation of all Lightwood predictors. The logic within can be complex at times, but thanks to the block abstraction we can deal with it in a structured manner. As this `ICP` block is used when generating predictions, it implements the two main methods that the `BaseAnalysisBlock` class specifies: `.analyze()` to setup everything that is needed, and `.explain()` to actually estimate the confidence in any given prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will go through the steps required to implement your own analysis blocks to customize the insights of any Lightwood predictor!\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will implement a \"model correlation heatmap\" block: we want to compare the predictions of all mixers inside a `BestOf` ensemble object, to understand how they might differ in their overall behavior."
