Think of Lightwood as [Keras](https://keras.io/)+[Ludwig](https://github.com/uber/ludwig) but for Pytorch, with two objectives:

- Make it so simple that you can build models with just a few lines of code.
- Make it so flexible that you can change and customize everything.


```python
pip3 install lightwood
```
We invite you to explore the [Lightwood's documentation site](https://mindsdb.github.io/lightwood/) to learn everything there is to know about the latest release.
